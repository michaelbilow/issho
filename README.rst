A issho and intuitive wrapper over paramiko_ that uses keyring_ to
manage secrets locally.

``issho`` is designed such that interacting with a
single, heavily used remote machine should
be *easy*, and working with more than one remote
machine should be *simple*.


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://issho.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

* Simple access for simple commands
    - Port forwarding
    - Executing commands over ssh
    - Transferring files over sftp

This package was created with Cookiecutter_
and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template.

The sftp work and testing framework is adapted from `Jeff Hinrichs`_'s
excellent pysftp_ package, and some of the ssh
framework is inspired by `Colin Wood`_'s sshed_.

Shout out to `Spencer Tipping`_, `Neal Fultz`_, and `Factual`_
for helping me learn to write my own tools.
